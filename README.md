# Algorithmic-Number-Theory

CS:370 Special Topics in Algorithmic Number Theory explored the basic concepts of number theory, particularly with their implications to cryptography and computer science. For this class I wrote a number of Python scripts for solving NT problems including: Greatest Common Denominatior (iterative and recursive), Prime tests (Trial division and Fermat test), and simple proof-of-concept implementations of RSA and Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange.

Python, with its readable syntax and easy iteration, was a natural fit for Number Theory. This class deepened my understanding of cryptography in theory and practice, and sharpened my mathematical problem solving skills.
